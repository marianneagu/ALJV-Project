## Setup
- Follow the steps [from the official release 21 docs](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents/blob/release_21_docs/docs/Installation.md).
- Use Python 3.11.3
- Use TensorBoard 2.16.2 or above
  
## Start training
- In console, go to [aljv-train](../aljv-train/) path
- To start a new training session with the default config file: 
```console
mlagents-learn --run-id=IDNAME
```
- To resume a training:
```console
mlagents-learn --run-id=IDNAME --resume
```
- To override a training:
```console
mlagents-learn --run-id=IDNAME --force
```
- To train a model with a custom config file add its path:
```console
mlagents-learn config/config.yaml --run-id=IDNAME 
```
- To open a TensorBoard session for data analytics:
```console
tensorboard --logdir results
```
